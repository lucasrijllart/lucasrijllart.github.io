In the recent years applications designed for learning have gained popularity, as they become an acceptable means of acquiring knowledge. These are proven to be a different and sometimes better way to teach young audiences because of the ability to incorporate a wide variety of teaching methods (Kirkwood & Price, 2014). The module Technology-Enhanced Learning Environments provides us with information on well-known methods used for learning, the theories of learning and how they influence design.

The problem we are trying to tackle is that history classes are not engaging enough to make the students interested, and for those who are, the technological resources are severely lacking. However, there is an engaging way to learn about events through storytelling. Everybody loves stories and can still remember the ones from our childhoods, so why not apply this to teaching history? This is where World Stories VR comes in.

World Stories VR is an immersive storytelling VR app where users can learn different topics of history, be it historical figures and their stories or countries and their past. The smartphone app, when paired with a VR headset, provides high-quality documentary-style lessons on a chosen topic to be enjoyed in the comfort of your own home.
