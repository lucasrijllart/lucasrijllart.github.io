PdfToList - CERN plan information extraction

date: July 2015

PdfToList is a tool I developed for CERN's civil engineering team to extract information from --HAG plans (for construction / planning) and organising it in an Excel spreadsheet. The information could then be communicated to the team and the data was ready for analysis.

The tool was developed in Python, using the pyPdf library for PDF handling and xlwt library for Excel handling.
