"Power is everything" is a side Scrolling Shmup with one core concept: your power bar limits your progression through the game. Every time 
you fire your power bar reduces. Every time you get hit your power bar reduces. The only way to get more power is to defeat enemies, but 
don’t miss too many times, if you don’t have enough power to defeat the boss at the end each wave of enemies, you're done for!

Created in C++ from scratch, all resources (except for the Font) were created by our team in the 48 hours as part of the GMTK Game Jam.

Featuring pseudo random enemies in ever increasing waves, the game plays like an endless runner where the user tries to stay alive for as long as possible. The visuals display 8 layers of parallax scrolling to give depth to the 2D world.

To play, move around with the arrow keys and fire with space bar. Kill all the enemies to continue. But be careful not to run out of power, it provides your health, your ammo, and your means of progression.
