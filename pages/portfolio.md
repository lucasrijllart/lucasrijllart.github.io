            I created an app that posts a new word or phrase and its definition every day in a picture on social media.

        <p>
            For the Global Game Jam of 2018, our 5-man team created a multiplayer game where friends have to defeat their friends by spawning monsters and activating traps in a creepy dungeon. The main player controls a gun-wielding character from a computer, whilst the others control the environment through their phones, enabling multiplayer on a single computer.  <a href="../2018/01/01/murder-with-friends.html">Read more...</a>

            In this hackathon, we combined Twitter and silly physics to create Fight Twitter – a slapstick fighting game where the fighters look like real twitter users. Just enter two Twitter usernames, and slap each other off the platforms to win. This was designed and implemented in 12 hours. <a href="/2017/12/03/fight-twitter.html">Read more...</a>

            Intelligent Systems MSc Thesis at Sussex University
            This project consists of applying machine learning to a robotic vehicle to make it create a model of its environment through its
            sensory information, allowing the autonomous completion of a goal. The robot will go through “sleep-wake” cycles to accelerate
            the process of problem solving, by doing “offline” processing with data gathered in real-time by the wake cycle.
