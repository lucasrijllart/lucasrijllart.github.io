[Environment-modelling robots with sleep-wake cycles — May-Aug 2017](../_posts/2017-08-01-sleep-wake.md)

<img src="../assets/img/portfolio/Sleep-Wake-logo.png">

Intelligent Systems MSc Thesis at Sussex University

This project consists of applying machine learning to a robotic vehicle to make it create a model of its environment through its sensory information, allowing the autonomous completion of a goal. The robot will go through “sleep-wake” cycles to accelerate the process of problem solving, by doing “offline” processing with data gathered in real-time by the wake cycle. Read more…
